Barnette Papers README
by Ted Morin

This document is an internal summary of the Barnette literature gathered here.
Documents are first sorted by importantance, then [very] briefly described.

Regrettably, the papers are not named correctly yet. This file should eventually be retitled and re-organized accordingly.

HIGH IMPORTANCE

surveyAndStrengtheningOfBarnette.pdf
Solid survey paper. Best available introduction to the problem.
Brings attention to and restates some significant Russian work (Kelmans).

holtonMckayC3CBP.pdf
Key work on Barnette graphs. Proves that Barnette graphs are Hamiltonian up to
N vertices.
Proves that ALL Barnette graphs can be constructed by "R0" and "R4" expansions.
Many interesting results on the way - notably shows that a non-Ham Barnette
graph of N vertices must indicate a smaller graph with certain properties...
LONG PAPER

BarnetteFinalDocument.pdf
Another good summary - written by students in Europe. Describes many strategies
and many interesting, accessible results. Many ideas are well-expressed. Kudos
to these folks!

onBarnettesConjecture.pdf
Proves conjecture with algorithm on subset of Barnette graphs.
Proves that if Barnette's conjecture is FALSE, then Ham Cycle on Barnette graphs
is NP-Complete!

MEDIUM IMPORTANCE

Alhalabi_finding_hamcycles_in_undirected_graphs.pdf
Describes a necessary condition for Hamiltonicity. Possibly useful?

DeLaTorreThesisInvestigationsOfBarnetteGraphs.pdf
Describes various results, notably investigates graph diameters?

ThoughtsOnBarnette2016.pdf
Proves Hamiltonicity for a subset of Barnette graphs.
Proves that finding a permeating tree based on face colorings is doomed to fail.
[We are investigating this proof.]

xue_mei_hamcycles_in_cubic_graphs.pdf
Looks like this one tries to use AI to find Ham cycles in Barnette graphs?
(Have read practically none of this one.)

LOW IMPORTANCE/PERIPHERAL

The four following documents relate to planar graphs generally:
onGeneratingPlanarGraphs.pdf
plantri-full.pdf
formats.txt
links.txt

graph2hamSAT.pdf
This document was grabbed to help convert graphs into SAT instances, but finding
permeating trees seems to be much faster.

Cahit_proof_of_barnette_conjecture.pdf
Alleged proof of conjecture - not peer-reviewed, disregarded.
Alleged procedure seems to find permeating trees, but counterexamples seem to
exist.
