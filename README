KEKTUPLE
========

Kektuple is an all-Python tool for researching the Barnette Conjecture.

The goal is to visualize and interact (and "play") with C3CBP graphs which
would be inconvenient to draw by hand. While more general and more
efficient graph manipulators exist, kektuple aims to be a simple tool which
makes the key properties of C3CBP graphs interactively accessible. So far,
kektuple's main feature is an implementation of the "R0" and "R4" expansions
which Holton and McKay (1984) proved could produce all Barnette graphs. 

The key files are 
kektup_helpers - self 
kektup         - the basic C3CBP class
iektup         - "interactive kektup"
vektup         - "visual kektup"
viektup        - "visual interactive kektup"
shektup        - "shell kektup"

To try out the code, clone the repository and run:
python shektup.py

Kektuple was created by researchers from the University of Dallas under
the supervision of Robert Hochberg. The code was mostly written by Ted Morin.

Kektuple is not yet associated with a peer reviewed publication.
